minor_changes:
- zos_job_submit - updates the module to correct the modules behavior such that
  the max_rc can declare if the module should fail when a non-zero return code
  is received.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/552).
- zos_job_submit - updates the module to not return a JCL ERROR code as a
  return code. JCL ERRORs are not return codes to be returned as part of the
  ret_code dictionary.
trivial:
- zos_job_submit - adds a number of test cases to cover max_rc and wait_time_s.
