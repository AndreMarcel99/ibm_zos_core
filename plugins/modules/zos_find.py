module: zos_find
version_added: '2.9'
short_description: Find matching data sets
description:
  - Return a list of data sets based on specific criteria. 
  - Multiple criteria are ANDâ€™d together.
  - Use the M(find) module to find USS files.
author: "Asif Mahmud (@asifmahmud)"
options:
  age:
    description:
      - Select data sets whose age is equal to or greater than the specified time.
      - Use a negative age to find data sets equal to or less than the specified time.
      - You can choose seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks by specifying the
        first letter of any of those words (e.g., "1w").
    type: str
    required: false
  age_stamp:
    description:
      - Choose the date property against which to compare age.
      - C(c_date) refers to creation date and C(r_date) refers to referenced date.
      - Only valid if C(age) is provided.
    type: str
    choices:
      - c_date
      - r_date
    default: r_date

  contains:
    description:
      - A regular expression or pattern which should be matched against the data
        set content.
    type: str
    required: false
  excludes:
    description:
      - One or more (shell or regex) patterns, which type is controlled by C(use_regex) option.
      - Data sets whose names match an excludes pattern are culled from patterns matches. 
        Multiple patterns can be specified using a list.
    type: list
    required: false
    aliases: ['exclude']
  patterns:
    description:
      - One or more (shell or regex) patterns, which type is controlled by C(use_regex) option.
      - The patterns restrict the list of data sets to be returned to those whose 
        names match at least one of the patterns specified. Multiple patterns 
        can be specified using a list.
      - When using regexes, the pattern MUST match the ENTIRE data set name, not just 
        parts of it.
      - This parameter expects a list, which can be either comma separated or YAML. 
        If any of the patterns contain a comma, make sure to put them in a list 
        to avoid splitting the patterns in undesirable ways.
    type: list
    required: true
  size:
    description:
      - Select data sets whose size is equal to or greater than the specified size.
      - Use a negative size to find files equal to or less than the specified size.
      - Unqualified values are in bytes but b, k, m, g, and t can be appended to 
        specify bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes, respectively.
    type: str
    required: false
  use_regex:
    description:
      - If C(true), patterns will be interpreted as python regex. Default is C(false).
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  paths:
    description:
      - List of PDS/PDSE to search. Wild-card possible.
      - Required only when searching for members, otherwise ignored.
    type: list
    required: false
  file_type;
    description:
      - The type of resource to search. The two choices are 'NONVSAM' and 'VSAM'.
      - 'NONVSAM' refers to one of SEQ, LIBRARY (PDSE), PDS, LARGE, BASIC, EXTREQ, EXTPREF.
    choices:
      - NONVSAM
      - VSAM
    type: str
    required: false
    default: NONVSAM
  volume:
    description:
      - If provided, only the data sets allocated in the specified list of volumes will be
        searched.
    type: list
    required: false
    aliases: ['volumes']
notes:
  - Only cataloged data sets will be searched. If an uncataloged data set needs to
    be searched, it should be cataloged first.
  - The M(zos_find) module currently does not support wildcards for high level qualifiers.
    For example, C(SOME.*.DATA.SET) is a valid pattern, but C(*.DATA.SET) is not.
